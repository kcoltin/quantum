"""Quantum Algorithm Simulator (QAS) is a library of functions and classes for
simulating the action of a quantum computer using Python. It contains two
classes - QubitSystem and QuantumGate - that simulate the two primary structures
used in quantum computing, quantum bits (qubits) and gates that operate on
systems of one or more qubits.
